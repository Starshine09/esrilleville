Copyright 2013-2015 Esrille Inc.

This product includes the design and the firmware of the Esrille New Keyboard
being developed at Esrille Inc. (http://www.esrille.com/keyboard/).

The Esrille New Keyboard is an ergonomically designed USB keyboard. It has 76
key switches (including two Fn keys), and is technically compatible with the
104/109 key USB keyboard.

The keyboard firmware of the Esrille New Keyboard currently supports the
following logical keyboard layouts:

English:
  * Qwerty
  * Dvorak
  * Colemak

Japanese:
  * Stickney Next
  * Nicola
  * M type
  * TRON
  * JIS X 6004

The keyboard firmware processes the above mentioned logical layouts inside the
keyboard, and no extra device driver installation is necessary.
